The app's core functionality revolves around fetching real-time news based on the selected category, such as Technology, Business, or Sports, using Axios for API integration.It leverages React's state management to dynamically update and display news articles in a responsive grid layout.

The NewsCard component renders individual news articles, including titles, images, and links to the full story, the Header component allows users to switch categories via a dropdown menu, and the Footer adds attribution and external links. The app is styled with Tailwind CSS and includes smooth animations to enhance user experience while maintaining a professional and interactive design.
